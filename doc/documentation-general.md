## Complements

### Theme
[Listify](https://themeforest.net/item/listify-wordpress-directory-theme/9602611?ref=colomet)
 is a top rated and popular directory theme. It’s compatible with several WordPress plugins (the WP Job Manager and WooCommerce plugins are required with the theme) and booking services as well. To add to this, [Astoundify provides detailed documentation](http://listify.astoundify.com/)
, and several hooks and settings to customize the look of the theme.

To be clear, the theme doesn’t come bundled with these plugins. You’ll have to download them yourself (and some may require a purchase). What we’ve done, however, is code the theme to support and style the integration with those plugins so that you can add all the functionality you like, while still looking great!

OpenBadgesFramework works with any theme. But we did integrate with several plugins and Listify in order to be able to enhance the power of the plugin. Thanks to those complements, Badges4Languages can offer a listing/directory for teachers and their classes, charge for the classes, and much more. With Listify, OpenBadgesFramework can:
* To offer a directory of classes (for Academies, Schools, Teachers,)
* To organize the students by classes (Unlimited classes)
* To offer profiles (for Teachers and their Academies/Schools)
* To have a rating (for classes and teachers)
* Advance filter system (Search teachers and classes)

### Plugins
The Plugin integrates with the following plugins right out of the box:

[WP Job Manager (free)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-job-manager/),
[Reviews for Job Manager (free)](https://astoundify.com/products/wp-job-manager-reviews/),
[Porfolio (by Badges4Languages)](https://github.com/Badges4Languages/).

#### Portolio
The Portfolio is a personal document of a learner. In this document learners of all ages can record their learning and cultural experiences at class or outside class.

* Teacher Porftolio (Full description of teachers' skills)

## OpenBadges
Open Badges are verifiable, portable digital badges with embedded metadata about skills and achievements. They comply with the Open Badges Specification and are shareable across the web.

Each Open Badge is associated with an image and information about the badge, its recipient, the issuer, and any supporting evidence. All this information may be packaged within a badge image file that can be displayed via online CVs and social networks. Thousands of organizations across the world issue badges in accordance with the Open Badges Specification, from non-profits to major employers to educational institutions at all levels.

### Developers Guide
Badges for Languages use [Mozilla's Open Badges Infrastructure (OBI)](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/what-open-badges-infrastructure "What is the Open Badges Infrastructure?") wich provides the open, core technology to support the ecosystem of badges.

The badges go from the plugin to the [Backpack](https://backpack.openbadges.org/backpack/welcome).

This section provides a set of technical resources to guide you through the processes of creating, issuing and displaying Open Badges. The Specification provides technical documentation and code examples. These guides will build on those examples.

[Developers Guide](https://openbadges.org/developers/)

[Open Badges Specification V2.0](https://www.imsglobal.org/sites/default/files/Badges/OBv2p0/examples/index.html "Open Badges v2.0 IMS Candidate Final")

[Open Badges Assertion Specification](https://github.com/mozilla/openbadges-specification/blob/master/Assertion/latest.md "Assertion Specification")

### openbadges-backpack
With the Issuer API, you can push earner badges to the Mozilla hosted Backpack. This tutorial will walk you through the process of sending earner badges to the Backpack via the Issuer API script. The API handles getting the earner's permission to push to their Backpack, so your own code only has to pass the details of badges you are trying to send, then if necessary retrieve the response from the API.

[Using the Issuer API](https://github.com/mozilla/openbadges-backpack/wiki/using-the-issuer-api)

As an issuer, you can push earner badges to the Mozilla hosted Backpack with their permission. You can do this using the Issuer API or using Backpack Connect. This guide demonstrates using the Backpack Connect approach to send earner badges to their Backpacks.

With the Issuer API, the user must grant permission every time you attempt to push to their Backpack. With Backpack Connect, you can manage user permission on an ongoing basis, using a persistent session. Once the earner has granted you permission to push badges to their Backpack, you will be able to do so without their interaction unless they revoke your permission, which they can do at any time.

To manage your interaction with the earner Backpack, the Connect API uses access tokens.
